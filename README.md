This is a pretty basic Python script I wrote because I had to take shelter from a storm and was bored for hours on end, it simply takes all the files in the given directory (or the current one if no input is provided) and organizes them by file type. Note that with the ever-expanding amount of file extensions this script will never cover them all, but will try to cover the most it can. It will break most imports unless made with this script in mind, but can clean up a messy desktop or something of that nature.
